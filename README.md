=============

A colour scheme that tries to replicate Vim's default. Effectively it
should be a no-op or equivalent to:

```vim
highlight clear
syntax reset
```


Why?
----

Making a colour scheme is time-consuming enough without having to go
hunting for what the default highlight groups are.


How to trigger various highlight groups
---------------------------------------

| Highlight group    | When itâ€™s used                                                                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
